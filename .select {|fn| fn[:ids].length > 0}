The procedural background of this case is complex:  In March 2010, Sky Angel filed a program access complaint against Discovery Communications, LLC and its affiliate, Animal Planet, L.L.C. (collectively, “Discovery”), as well as a petition for a standstill extending rights it had under its affiliation agreement with Discovery.  See Sky Angel Program Access Complaint; Sky Angel U.S., LLC, Emergency Petition for Temporary Standstill, MB Docket No. 12-80, File No. CSR-8605-P (March 24, 2010).  When Sky Angel filed its complaint, it provided a national subscription-based service of approximately eighty channels of video and audio programming including MLB Network, NFL Network, Hallmark Channel, and Weather Channel via a set-top box that has a broadband Internet input and video outputs that connect directly to a television set.  See Sky Angel Complaint at 1-9.  Sky Angel filed its complaint and standstill request with the Commission after receiving notice that Discovery intended to terminate its affiliation agreement with Sky Angel covering certain Discovery networks.  The Media Bureau denied the standstill request on the basis that Sky Angel failed to carry its burden of demonstrating that it is likely to succeed in showing on the merits that it is an MVPD entitled to seek relief under the program access rules.  Sky Angel Standstill Denial, 25 FCC Rcd at 3882-83, ¶ 7.  Sky Angel subsequently filed a renewed petition for standstill.
